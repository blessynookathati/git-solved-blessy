# DevOps Simulator Architecture

## Overview
The system utilizes a standard microservices architecture for reliable deployment and monitoring. Key components include the Configuration Service, Monitoring Agent, and Deployment Scheduler. All communication is secured via mutual TLS.

## Data Flow
Configuration is pulled from a centralized database (PostgreSQL/Redis), pushed to agents via a message queue (Kafka), and executed by the Deployment Scheduler.

## New Experimental AI Layer (V3.0)
An experimental layer has been added for AI-powered optimization. This layer uses a decoupled event-driven architecture to integrate:
* Predictive Scaling Modules
* Anomaly Detection Services
* Chaos Engineering Tools

**Note:** This layer is currently in testing and disabled by default in production settings.
